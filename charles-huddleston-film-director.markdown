# Current Project

A live-action feature-length VR 360 film about a private detective investigating a humanoid robot companion who may be involved in the disappearance of another cop. When a hacker exploits a defect in her code, she begins to ask questions about her existence and whether it's actually the humans who have been programmed.

Filmed entirely on location with real human actors, the audience is fully immersed in a mysterious retro-futuristic film noir. There's no motion capture or computer-generated characters to get in the way of the actors' performances or the story.
